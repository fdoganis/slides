Check SinglePlayer 3D demo


Install model locally

"
It is possible to run this offline, by downloading the entire model in a folder structure.
For example: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/networked-hand-3js-tf174-handv1
where the models are downloaded to the /public/frozen/models/ folder.
Simply change the path to point to the local link, and it should then work.
